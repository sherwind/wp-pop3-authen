wp-pop3-authen

This WordPress plugin allows the use of a POP3 server for authentication.

How to use

Create WordPress accounts with the same usernames as your POP3
accounts. The passwords can be anything since they will not be
passed to the POP3 server. Only the users you create in WordPress
will be able to log in. The "admin" user will still be authenticated
by WordPress.


INSTALLATION

1. Upload the wp-pop3-authen directory to the wp-content/plugins directory.
2. Set the POP3 server address and port in wp-pop3-authen.php.
3. Activate the plugin on the Plugins Management page.

Note: This plugin has only been tested with WordPress 2.7, 2.8, and 3.0
