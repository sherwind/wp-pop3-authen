wp-pop3-authen

This WordPress plugin allows the use of a POP3 server for authentication.

How to use

Create WordPress accounts that match the names of your POP3 accounts.
The passwords don't have to match since they will not be passed to
the POP3 server. Only the users you create in WordPress will be
able to log in, except for the "admin" user which will still be
authenticated by WordPress.


INSTALLATION

1. Upload the folder named wp-pop3-authen to the wp-content/plugins folder.
2. Set the POP3 server address and port in wp-pop3-authen.php.
3. Activate the plugin on the Plugins screen.

Note: This plugin has only been tested with WordPress 2.7 and 2.8
